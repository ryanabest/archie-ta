      "intro": "Welcome to The Athletic's 2025 NFL Playoff Simulator, where you'll find everything you need to know about all the ways your favorite team's season could end, from a No. 1 playoff seed to the first overall pick in the 2026 Draft.",
      "methodology": "About this simulator: We create an offensive and defensive projection for every NFL team from a linear regression model that incorporates various metrics, such as Expected Points Added and Success Rate. These projections estimate how many points each team would be expected to score and allow in a game against an average opponent at a neutral site. We then assign a probability of how likely a team is to win a given game by adjusting for opponent and location. Taking into account each team's current record, health and remaining schedule, we use these game-by-game projections to simulate the rest of the season (including the playoffs) 100,000 times.",
